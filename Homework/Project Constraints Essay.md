	One topical area that applies to our solution is Social. While our project will most likely be used by more than just non-profits, our goal is for the project to have a benefit for society. This benefit is improving public spaces by making it easier for volunteers and city organizations to coordinate cleanup efforts, enhancing community health and quality of life. Because our project has this benefit to society, we want to make sure the application is user-friendly and provides a good experience for everyone.   
Another area is Environmental. Our project should positively impact environmental conditions by helping reduce the amount of litter in public spaces. Since it is a site that identifies areas with high litter accumulation, it will help to improve local environments by encouraging faster and more organized cleanups. To achieve this, we need to ensure high litter areas are easily identifiable, which we can do by making sure location markers are easy to access and accurate.  
A third topical area that constrains our project is Ethical. Because users will be able to upload images and location data, we need to ensure that the information collected does not invade privacy or expose individuals unintentionally. Our team will design the system to anonymize user submissions and ensure photos do not contain identifiable people or private property. We also want to ensure that our system cannot be used to make false or harmful reports.  
	Finally, Security is another important constraint on our project. Our platform will involve user accounts and data storage, so we must protect information through secure authentication protocols, encrypted communication, and careful database design. Preventing unauthorized access or data leaks is essential for maintaining public trust in our platform.
