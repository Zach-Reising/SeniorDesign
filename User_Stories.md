## User Stories

---

- As a community member, I want to view and add litter markers on the map so that others can see where cleanup is needed.

- As an organization leader, I want to be able to view current markers and be able to add and remove markers that my organization plans to clean up, so that the map reflects which locations are still in need of attention.

- As an administrator, I want to be able to assign and update user roles so that each user has the correct permissions.

- As a volunteer, I want to be able to filter or search markers (by status, date, or location) so I can easily find relevant cleanup opportunities.

- As a user, I want to be able to create an account and log in, so I can contribute and track my activity.

- As a user, I want to be able to upload a photo when adding or resolving a marker, so cleanup efforts are documented.
